## Old practices but new definitions for a new era

This project is an Open Collaboration to define, refine, and iterate on definitions derived from the special word _Open_:

__“Open means anyone can freely access, use, modify, and share for any purpose (subject, at most, to requirements that preserve provenance and openness).”__

— the [Open Definition](https://opendefinition.org/)

One specific goal is to bring together existing Open definitions and their creators with other people who advocate for creating and working in this Open way.

## Contribution guidelines

This is a new effort without any actual governance, which is quite typical for a [project starting out with just one or two founders](https://www.theopensourceway.org/the_open_source_way-guidebook-2.0.html#_work_among_founders_1_or_2_members).
This is also encouraging!
Wisely, we are waiting for there to be a critical mass of people to participate in the creation of their own governance.
And again, [common practice](https://www.theopensourceway.org/the_open_source_way-guidebook-2.0.html#_early_project_growth_up_to_5_members).

If you would like to participate, you may use the native GitHub tools to create issues, hold discussions, and propose changes.
Reach out to project founder [@quaid](https://github.com/quaid) (Karsten Wade) for encouragement and answers to your questions.

When we create a stand-alone publicly archived discussion forum, directions to join that forum will replace this sentence.

## Resources

Existing Open definitions:
- [The Open definition](https://opendefinition.org)
- [The Open Work definition](https://openworkdefinition.com)
- [The Open Source definition](https://opensource.org/osd/)

Already in use definitions without canonical wording or sourcing:
- __Open Scholarship__
  - [Open Scholarship](https://guides.library.pdx.edu/c.php?g=931273&p=6711316#:~:text=Open%20Scholarship%20is%20defined%20by,knowledge%20is%20created%20and%20shared.) from Portland State University library.
  - [Search results for _open scholarship definition_](https://www.google.com/search?q=open+scholarship+definition) with nine different definitions from nine different Universities in (at least) four countries.
  - This [Open Scholarship](https://forrt.org/glossary/open-scholarship/) definition is from [FORTT](https://ofrrt.org) (Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training), they are an example of an organization that might like to participate in a commons of Open Definitions.
    Then with a single definition, it could be promoted to academic and research insititutions globally.
 - __Open Science__
   - Important enough for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to publish their own [page long definition](https://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/open-science.htm).
   - There is a long [Wikipedia page on Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) that is well resourced, but also lacks a short and memorable definition.-
- The list continues ...
